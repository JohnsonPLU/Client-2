<h1>Needs for client 2</h1>
<p class="Client2">Client 2 needs 5 cheap computers that are strong enough to play the lastest games but the only that he needs is to linux and all 5 of them like to tinker with the programs. They also feel very comfortable setting up things on linux and the 5 of them need similar computers and they mainly use git and github to acompolish their work and communicate with each other.They would like to have the best connectivity that we can setup for them. The programs they tend to use are highly graphic and intensive and it will take most of their space so they would need a lot of space for their programs and they would like to have a network system storage to hold all of their assets that are going to be created from their artist(Client #1). They tend to prefer mechanical keyboards and a mouse that has a lot of button options so that they can setup macros to speed up their work.</p>
<h2>Networking</h2>
<p class="For">For the networking I have given them a TP-Link TL-WDN4800 for the wifi adaptor and for the wifi router i have given them the D-Link Wireless AC1750 Dual-Band Router (DIR-867) so that they can have a good internet fo playing their games or allow them to do stuff on git and github. For the topology of their computers I will make them computers go into a ring network the ring network is similar to the star topology but the ring topology goes around in a ring taking turns to send and recieve data from another computer.</p>

<h3>Reasoning</h3>
<p class="I">I think these are the best selections for client 2 because they want the right computer to play the latest games on their computer and so they would also need a lot of storage for their highly intense graphics of their projects. They would also like to have a mechanical keyboards, Mouses with a lot of buttons that they can a adjust.
<h4>Reflection</h4>
<ul class="found">
    <li>I found that sourcing was the hardest part of this assignment</li>
    <li>What I learned about this assignment was that I was supposeto find things on my own for someones needs</li>
    <li>No because the other client would like me to build the most expensive computer for them</li>
</ul>
